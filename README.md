# BCI4ALS-Motor Imagery repository

This repository contains the formal scaffolding code used in 2021-2022 BCI4ALS academic course.
Currently we support the MATALB version, but intend to add Python support soon.
For earlier versions, including the BCI4ALS code that works for the SSVEP paradigm, please check out the SSVEP repo here (https://github.com/harelasaf/BCI4ALS-SSVEP).
